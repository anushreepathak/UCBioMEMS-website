                    <li><font size="2">Dr. Ahn has developed and realized several new magnetic MEMS concepts and components in a fully integrated fashion on &quot;silicon chips&quot; for MEMS applications: a planar micromachined spiral inductor for MEMS applications; a new toroidal-meander type integrated inductor; a fully integrated micromachined toroidal type inductor; a fully integrated magnetic microactuator with cantilever beam; a planar magnetic micromotor; a bio-magnetic particle separator or manipulator;
a rotary magnetic fluid micropump; and a fully integrated DC/DC converter. From the international MEMS community, this work has been recognized as important pioneering work for the field of magnetic MEMS, clearly showing the feasibility of magnetic driving in micro scale and thus opening the technology for a variety of new research applications in biomedical, chemical, automotive, and power electronic MEMS applications with the developed technologies.</font></li>
                    <li><font size="2">After joining the University of Cincinnati, new research areas such as microfluidic systems, optical I/O couples and bio/chemical sensors have been successfully initiated as follows: (1) Microfluidic systems have been developed. Magnetically driven microvalves and pumps have been realized for a microfluidic system for remote bio/chemical sensors, in which the concepts of a movable permalloy/silicon diaphragm have been considered as an innovative generic approach in implementing
magnetic microactuators. (2) Micromachined optical I/O couplers have been developed. A micromachined prototype optical I/O coupler which is composed of a GaAs Metal-Semiconductor-Metal (MSM) photodetector, a silicon micromirror and an optical fiber have been proposed and implemented. The developed optical I/O coupler provides a practical solution in realizing Optoelectronic Multichip Modules (OE-MCMs) or on-chip optical sensing systems for the ever increasing communication bottleneck problem when confronted with
a multitude of computing and information gathering and processing units. (3) Micromachined on-chip bio/chemical sensors have been developed. An innovative micromachined immunosensor based on an electrochemical immunoassay has been realized on a silicon wafer using a polyimide substrate for the attachment of antibody. The innovative immunosensor envisages the realization of a remote bio/chemical sensor system on a chip using both a microfluidic system and an electrochemical immunoassay.</font></li>
